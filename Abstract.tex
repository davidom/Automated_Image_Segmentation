\section{Abstract}
Methods for image segmentation are numerous but usually only apply to a specific feature or implement a specific strategy relevant to the image features that are desired. There have been efforts to combine current segmentation tools with the goal of creating a more general tool [REFERENCES]. However, this work seeks to provide a higher level of automation to the image segmentation process by combining multi-objective optimization and machine learning in order to segment a large collection of similar images. This was done by first identifying orthogonal components that define image features: color, texture, geometry, and motion. A multi-objective optimization technique was used for determining an optimum combination of the above components for segmenting a single image. The next step is to use our multi-objective optimization technique for matching the segmented shapes in the initial image to the most similar shapes in the second image in the data set. Optimal shapes are determined based upon color, texture, geometry, and motion. This process is then repeated in order to segment the remaining images in the data set. Machine learning is used as the optimization process is ongoing in order to determine the most appropriate values for the weights of the relevant terms in the objective function for a set of images.
